# Dues

As an initiated member of Pi Kappa Phi you took a vow to be a brother for life.
Just because you’ve finished your undergraduate career doesn’t mean there are no
more dues. Ironically, now that you have an increased income your dues are
substantially less.

Your dues are important to this organization. They help us be able to put on
programming from philanthropic fundraisers to social events for alumni.
More importantly, this money helps us to give back and support the undergraduate
chapter that we all care for so deeply.

Membership dues are as follows (yearly subscription):

Under 30: $25

Over 30: $50

Please make checks payable to: Theta Psi Alumni Chapter, Inc.

Renew (one time only):

* Level 1 ($25)
* Level 2 ($50)
