Our Fraternity has a strong tradition of alumni involvement.
How can you become more involved?

## Online

Every Alumni should have been invited to join the [Theta Psi Alumni Facebook
group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/116095031796783/).
If you need an invitation, contact the Alumni Secretary [at] secretary@thetapsi.org.

As an alumni in good standing, you are welcome to have a ThetaPsi.org mailing
address, free of charge. Additionally, there are numerous positions and roles
that you may join in order to help our organization grow and prosper.

Additionally, we have a [LinkedIn group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/6544800/).
This group can help you find brothers in your field or serve as a good starting
point for brothers that are looking for a job.

## In Person

Throughout the year the alumni chapter holds different events.
Our annual meeting is held every year during RIT Brick City Weekend.
Additionally we strive to hold other events, frequently coinciding
with major undergraduate events. For information on events please
join our mailing list. To join, please email sysop [at] thetapsi.org.

To stay on top of our activities, join our mailing list to get a copy of
our newsletter. This newsletter will strive to keep alumni updated on
chapter needs, events, and successes.
Additionally, it will serve to disseminate alumni information and news.
Keep an eye on your email for this!

## Leadership Positions

There are two governing bodies that alumni may seek to join:

1. The Council of Advisers (CoA)
2. The Executive Council of the alumni chapter

Additional involvement is encouraged to help plan and organize alumni events
throughout the year. If you are interested in playing an active role in this
chapter, please contact the Secretary.
